* Run `npm install` from the project root.
* Run `ionic serve` in a terminal from the project root.
* Profit. :tada:

_Note: You may need to add “sudo” in front of any global commands to install the utilities._



## Deploying

* PWA - Un-comment [this](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base/blob/master/src/index.html#L21), run `npm run ionic:build --prod` and then push the `www` folder to your favorite hosting service
